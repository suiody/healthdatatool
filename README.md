Motivation: Development databases contain a wealth of information, yet many are geared toward analysts, or others in technical roles, and the user interfaces require a bit of a learning curve. 

This open source project aims to:  
- to provide a simple, intuitive web app to enable users to search several popular development databases for health and environmental datasets
- allow users to quickly visualize data and download results


The completed app will:
- enable users query popular development databases
- provide a simple graphing application to visualize the different datasets
- enable download data in .csv format, or graphs as .jpg or .png format
- have access to some archived data for popular datasets, in the event that one of the databases is not accessible, enabled by a back-end rails API
